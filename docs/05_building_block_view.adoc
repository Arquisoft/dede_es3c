We have two types of actors interacting with the application:

  - User: Is the owner of his POD. He interacts with the system through user view (this view will be explained in level 2).
  - Administrator: He interacts with the system via admin view (this view will be explained in level 2).

The application is represented as a whitebox. Inside of it we can see the three layers of MVC (Model View Controller) convention.
